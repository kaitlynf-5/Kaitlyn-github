    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this project we'll be answering business questions using the \"Chinook\" data model which represents a digital media store, and contains tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices and customers. Media related data was created using real data from an iTunes Library. Customer and employee information was manually created using fictitious names, addresses that can be located on Google maps, and other well formatted data (phone, fax, email, etc.). Sales information is auto generated using random data for a four year period.\n",

A single invoice can contain multiple tracks purchased by a customer, the details of which are in the `invoice_line` table which contains invoice_line IDs. The `invoice_line` table also gives us a track ID that can be used to look up the details of the tracks purchased, like the artist ID, album ID, & length of song in the `track` table. Tracks can be composed into a playlist. The `playlist_track` table contains playlist IDs and the track ID's of the songs in each playlist. The table `playlist` contains playlist names and their respective playlist ID's. The `artist` and `album` tables contain information about the artist and albums for tracks. Lastly, tracks may have a genre and media type, which can be found in the `genre` and `media_type` tables."

The record label specializes in artists from the USA, and they have given Chinook some money to advertise the new albums in the USA, so we're interested in finding out which genres sell the best in the USA.

    "Based on our output table, Rock tracks made up 53% of tracks sold by Chinook in the USA. Unfortunately, none of our prospective artists fall into this genre. The next most popular genre was Alternative & Punk with 12% of tracks sold. The artist Red Tone falls into this genre. Blues, Pop, and Hip-Hop each respectively make up 2-3% of the total tracks sold. If we can only pick 3 artists, then Red Tone, Slim Jim Bites, and Meteor and the Girls make good selections since they have the highest relative tracks_sold. It's worth noting that there is only a difference of two tracks sold between Regal's genre \"Hip Hop/Rap\" and Meteor and the Girls' genre of \"Pop\". With more data we might look into how many social media followers the artists have to add another lens to our analysis. For this exercise, we'll go with a recommendation that the Red Tone, Slim Jim Bites, and Meteor and the Girls albums be added to the Chinook store. We might also recommend that Chinook try to source more Rock and Metal artists to be added to the store in the future."
