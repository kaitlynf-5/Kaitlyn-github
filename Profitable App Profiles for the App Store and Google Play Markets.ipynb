The top 4 genres (Games, Entertainment, Photo & Video, and Social Networking) seem to be designed for fun and pleasure versus Productivity/Utilities which we see at lower frequencies. Even though Games make up 56% of apps in the App Store, this does not necessarily mean these apps have the most users. We will look into app usage later on.

    "The most frequent genre is 'Tools', however this genre only makes up 8% of apps. Since 'Tools' is only the third most frequent category, you may be wondering why it's the most frequent genre. One reason is that there is no genre called 'Family'. Let's print the genres of the ten most reviewed apps we listed above. The top 10 most reviewed 'FAMILY' games fall into a few different genres like 'Strategy', 'Casual', and 'Entertainment'. Since there is no genre called 'Games' (other than Brain Games), 'Family' apps end up falling into multiple genres, with children's games labelled as 'Casual' for our top 10 apps. Since we are only looking for a high-level classification of what type of app to develop, we should be ok to focus on the `Category` column instead of the `genre` column for the Google Play store data set.

We have data about the number of installs for the Google Play market. The number of installs is not a precise number, but rather a rounded number that represents a 'floor' number of installs (Ex. 10,000+, 1,000,000+). Although this value isn't precise, we can still use it to determine the popularity of an app category."

    "- 'Reference' apps have the highest average number of user ratings in the App Store, followed by Music, Social Networking, and Weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'Communication' apps have the highest average number of installs in the Google Play store, followed by Video Players, Social, and Entertainment apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage I like the profile of an Entertainment/Reference app. As mentioned in our introduction, since this app is free, our revenue source is in-app ads viewed by the user. An interesting [study](https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/cell-phone-usage-in-toilet-survey) by BankMyCell suggests that 3 in 4 Americans admit to using their phone whilst on the toilet. Also 88% of Android owners and 76% of iPhone owners use their device on the toilet. Based on these stats along with the data we have analyzed, the app we decide to pitch is called 'Toilet Trivia'. It is an app that will tell you entertaining fun facts while you're on the toilet. The app might also include trivia quizzes to make it more engaging. This type of app would result in users spending time in the app (depending on how long they're in the bathroom). While people surveyed in the BankMyCell study listed using social media, messaging, listening to music, watching videos, and mobile gaming as activities they do while on the toilet, a trivia app might put a more productive spin on this time, and therefore might be appealing to users who want to do something less mindless.\n",

    "In this project, we analyzed data about the App Store and Google Play mobile apps with the goal of recommending an app profile that can be profitable for both markets.\n",

    "When we combined our analysis with a study that found that 88% of Android owners and 76% of iPhone owners use their device on the toilet, we decided on creating an app called \"Toilet Trivia\" with fun facts and trivia quizzes meant to be used while in the loo could be profitable for both the Google Play and the App Store markets."
